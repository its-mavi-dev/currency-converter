This currency converter is a small functionality-focused website that converts the value of 145 international currencies between one another.

The reason I created it is that I have some background in forex and thought it would be cool to build a tool like this.

It is easy to use. Just select the currencies you want from the dropdown menu, input the amount you want to convert, and then click convert.

You can check out the Live Link to see the Project.
